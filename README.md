# Phantom-Pacer
Phantom Pacer is an idea myself and two other engineering students at my school started. For our Senior Capstone Project we decide that creating a scale version of our product was the best option given our budget of $500. As we worked on the project we decide to enter a business pitch competition at the end of the year to display what we had done to the whole school, get practice of creating business plans, and hopefully win the prize money. We ended up winning the pitch competition and to our surprise our product had a lot of interest from potential buyers. As of right now we have decide to make Senior Capstone Project into a real product! Unfortunately, but for good reason, I cannot upload the software or hardware design because we are currently working on patenting out hardware, software, and manufacturing process with hopes to start renting our product starting 2026!

## What is it?
Phantom Pacer is a 400-meter pacing system that track and field athletes use during a race. It is a string of LED lights that go around the track at a pace set by the user. The runners would follow the lights around the track providing them perfect pacing! The user of the system can control all the details through an app. The details the user controls through the app are pace per lap, number of laps, selecting between four different color options, choose multiple paces (each pace having it's own color), and when to start/stop the system.

## What we have!
We currently have a fully functional 10-meter prototype with working software. 

## Where can you see the prototype?
Within the "images and videos" folder there are videos of the 10-meter system as well as recordings of the app (currently using Blynk for protoyping)
